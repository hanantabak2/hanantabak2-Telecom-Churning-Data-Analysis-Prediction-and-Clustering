# hanantabak2-Telecom-Churning-Data-Analysis-Prediction-and-Clustering
This is a comprehensive project that might be useful to data scientists in Telecom industry. It studies the case of Customers Churning which is very common in Telecommunication companies.
In this project, I did EDA, perdictive modelling and customers clustering.
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a companyâ€™s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate. It's importatnt because keeping an existing customer saves more money to the company than attracting a new one.
 Churn rate has strong impact on the life time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the company.
